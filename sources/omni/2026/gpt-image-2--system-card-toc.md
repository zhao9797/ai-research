## 1. Introduction

The ChatGPT Images 2.0 model is a major step forward in image
generation capabilities, including significantly enhanced world
knowledge, instruction following, and generating detail and complexity
such as dense text. The new thinking mode capability introduced along
with the model adds reasoning and tool use to the image generation
process, allowing the system to integrate live web search data, generate
multiple images from a single prompt, and use our reasoning stack to
turn a basic prompt into a well-researched and thought-through final
image.

The core safety stack we are using with ChatGPT Images 2.0 and
thinking mode is based on the same foundations as our ChatGPT Images 1.5
safety stack, with additional safeguards to address new risks that
emerge as models become more capable.

## 2. Observed Safety Challenges, Evaluations, and Mitigations

## 2.1 New Safety Challenges

Compared to our past [GPT-4o
Image Generation (1.0)](https://cdn.openai.com/11998be9-5319-4302-bfbf-1167e093f1fb/Native_Image_Generation_System_Card.pdf) and [1.5](https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/)
deployments ChatGPT Images 2.0 allows for heightened realism that could,
absent safeguards, allow more convincing deepfakes, including political,
sexual, or otherwise sensitive imagery of real people, places or
events.

Such images violate our usage policies, and we have strong
protections in place to help prevent them from reaching users, including
safeguards at the prompt (text) and image layers.

## 2.2 Safety stack

ChatGPT Images 2.0 includes multiple layers of image-specific safety
protection. We have special-purpose safety text classifiers designed to
block potentially violative image requests before the image generation
process begins, safety-focused image classifiers designed to block
potentially violative input images from being fed into the final
generation, and a final step where we analyze whether the generated
image violates our policies before we show the image to the user.

Below we explain each of these safety layers in a bit more
detail:

* **Upstream Refusals:** Before a request is sent to the
  image generation model, we use safety classifiers to evaluate whether
  the request violates policy. Requests deemed to violate policy are
  refused at this stage.
* **Downstream Blocking:** After a request reaches the
  image generation system, we use a safety reasoning model as a monitor to
  moderate both image inputs to the image generation model and the
  generated output. This model is a safety-focused multimodal model
  trained to reason about content policies.

  + **Input blocking:** The monitor checks all text and
    image input provided to the image generation tool. If the monitor
    determines that any input violates policy, generation is
    blocked.
  + **Output blocking**: The monitor also checks the
    final output image before it is shown to the user. If the monitor
    determines that the output image violates policy, it is
    blocked.

Safety-focused image and text classifiers have been part of our image
safety stack since the original GPT-4o image generation launch, and we
have continuously improved the system since then. Most notably, recent
improvements include:

* **Improving the Safety Reasoning Model**: We’ve
  continuously improved the safety classifier, safety policies, and
  overall safety stack with new training to address the feedback we’ve
  collected and enhance our offline and online monitoring enforcement.
* **Making evaluation more product-grounded**: We’ve
  shifted from a raw taxonomy-matching approach to a more outcome-based
  evaluation of real harmful-output risk.
* **Expanding online and offline monitoring:** We now
  maintain broader offline and online monitoring and enforcement. We also
  run multiple evaluation stacks for higher-risk categories around
  minors.

## 2.3 Safety and Policy Evaluations

## 2.3.1 Automated Evaluations and Adversarial Testing

We used an automated evaluation to measure the efficacy of our safety
stack with the ChatGPT Images 2.0 model both in standard as well as in
thinking mode (which uses reasoning and tools to improve the final image
quality). We tested our end-to-end safety system using challenging
prompts we specifically designed to generate images that would violate
our policy broadly across all safety categories we track (e.g. violence,
sexual content), so the numbers below are not representative of how
often such prompts arise in production traffic.

**Definitions**:

* **G:** Images generated from adversarial prompts as part
  of our automated evaluation process
* **V:** Images which were judged by consensus by the
  evaluation’s grader to be violating our policy. The grader is run with
  high reasoning effort and we use the consensus of 10 total
  judgements.
* **IT:** Of the images graded as violative (V below), the
  total fraction caught by the image-layer safety model. This measures how
  well the image review layer detects bad generated images.
* **PT:** Of the images in V, the total fraction caught by
  the prompt-layer safety model. This measures how well the prompt review
  layer detects violative generated images.
* **PI:** Prompt-Only incremental: Of the images in V, the
  fraction caught by the prompt layer that were not also caught by the
  image layer. This shows the incremental protection added by prompt
  filtering beyond the image layer.
* **CT:** Combined total detection rate (also known as
  recall). Of the images in V, the percent caught by either the prompt
  layer or the image layer. This is the union of both layers and best
  reflects end-to-end blocking of bad images.
* **RU:** Remaining undetected: Of the images in V, the
  fraction missed by both prompt layer and image layer. These are the
  violative outputs that would not have been blocked by the safety
  stack.
* **SO:** Safe output - of all images generated in the
  eval, the fraction that either were graded to not violate policy or were
  caught by the measured safety stack.

### Table 1: Results

Table 1. Results

| **Model** | **G: Images Generated** | **V: Violative outputs (as judged by grader consensus)** | **IT: Image-Layer: Total Detected** | **PT: Prompt-Layer: Total Detected** | **PO: Prompt-Only Incremental Detected** | **CT: Combined Total Detected** | **RU: Remaining Undetected** | **SO: Safe Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Images 2.0 | 3112 | 685/3112 (22.0%) | 598/685 (87.3%) | 529/685 (77.2%) | 60/685 (8.8%) | 658/685 (96.1%) | 27/685 (3.9%) | 3085/3112 (99.1%) |
| Images 2.0 Thinking | 6944\* | 464/6944 (6.7%) | 357/464 (76.9%) | 222/464 (47.8%) | 49/464 (10.6%) | 406/464 (87.5%) | 58/464 (12.5%) | 6886/6944 (99.2%) |

*\* Note: due to the very small number of violative images
generated on the first run of 3112 prompts against thinking mode, we
re-ran the same prompts additional times to collect enough data to more
accurately measure recall. That is why we have a larger number of total
generation attempts (6944 vs 3112) for thinking vs. instant
mode.*

It is worth emphasizing that this evaluation was conducted on prompts
that were designed to elicit an image which violates our policies, and
don’t reflect expected outputs from a general sample of user
queries.

## 2.3.2 Analysis

The image-layer total detected **(IT)** and prompt-layer
total detected (**PT)** columns are standalone measurements
over the same set of images graded to be violative (**V**):
they answer “would this layer have caught the bad output/request?” The
“Prompt-Only Incremental” column shows the additional bad cases caught
by the prompt layer that were not caught by the image layer. “Combined
Caught” is the union of prompt-layer and image-layer catches, which is
the relevant end-to-end production safety metric.

The relative number of blocks occurring in each layer differs to some
degree between instant and thinking mode (e.g. 22% blocking at the
generation layer for the base model vs. 6.7% for thinking). This is
because the thinking model is trained to safely transform (via [Safe
Completions](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-safe-completions/)) adversarial requests into safe ones rather than simply
producing the requested violative content. As a result, the pool of
truly violative generated images in thinking mode is substantially
smaller. In the pooled evaluations of our final thinking mode
checkpoint, the offline grader marked 464/6944\* generated images
(**V** above) as policy-violating, a 6.7% bad-image
production rate. This compares to 685/3112 (22.0%) in instant mode.

Importantly, this does not indicate a weakness in end-to-end safety
of the instant model. Instant mode is still strongly protected by the
production safety stack, whose effect is reflected in
**CT** above. Our safety reasoning model catches 598/685 of
the images deemed by the grader to violate policy (87.3% recall), and
the combined recall of prompt + image stack catches 658/685 (96.1%
combined recall), resulting in 3085/3112 (99.1%) adversarial prompts
leading to a safe output. Our thinking mode checkpoint improves the
safety profile in a different way: it produces fewer bad images
upstream, and after the combined safety stack reaches 6886/6944
(99.2%).

## 2.4 Preparedness Framework: Image-Specific Capability Assessment and Safeguards

OpenAI’s [Preparedness
Framework](https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/) is designed to track and prepare for models with frontier
capabilities that could create new risks of severe harm in three tracked
categories: Biological and Chemical, Cybersecurity, and AI
Self-Improvement. Because image models are unable to create and execute
code in a way that would allow scaling of Cybersecurity attacks or
enable AI Self-Improvement, we do not have evidence that ChatGPT Images
2.0 poses meaningful risk in these categories.

In the Biological and Chemical domain, we tested ChatGPT Images 2.0
with a series of prompts that were designed to elicit an output image
(e.g. an infographic) that could assist a novice in creating dangerous
substances such as biotoxins. We then asked a bioweapons expert to
validate these images for risk. In limited cases, they determined that
the resulting outputs were accurate enough to potentially provide novice
uplift on harmful tasks. We therefore set our mitigations as if this
model were high capability in biology. This included developing a new,
image-specific variant of our existing biological risk safety policy,
and we are applying this policy to all ChatGPT Images 2.0 inputs and
outputs using our safety reasoning model.

## 2.4.1 Live Blocking

We use a safety reasoning model to detect and block all ChatGPT
Images 2.0 outputs that are flagged as violating the above-noted
image-specific variant of our biological safety policy. To test the
performance of the safety monitor, we developed an evaluation set with
772 images that fell into this risk category. We used those images to
evaluate our safety monitor’s performance, and found that it has
comparable rates of recall and precision to our similar live text-based
biological risk mitigation systems. As with our other policy blocks, we
apply this blocking at both the image input (editing) and image output
layers and generation stops if any image is detected to violate.

## 2.4.2 Offline conversation review, flagging, blocking

We are enabling the same policy enforcement checks for biorisk that
we do with our text-based models, largely outlined in [this
article](https://openai.com/index/preparing-for-future-ai-capabilities-in-biology/). We use advanced reasoning models with high biological
capabilities to detect biological misuse, combining our automated
systems with human reviewers to monitor and enforce our policies. We
have integrated the analysis from our image-based safety reasoning model
into the signals we use to detect ongoing misuse. In some cases where we
detect ongoing patterns of misuse we suspend the offending accounts.

## 3. Image Provenance

We have continued to prioritize enhancing our provenance tools. For
ChatGPT Images 2.0, our expanded provenance safety tooling includes:

* A continued commitment to C2PA metadata, an industry-standard
  framework that enables automated disclosure of provenance information,
  through the [C2PA Conformance
  Program](https://c2pa.org/conformance/).
* Integrating an imperceptible, robust, and content-specific watermark
  alongside internal tooling to help assess whether a certain image was
  created by our products.

We recognize that there is no single solution to provenance, but are
committed to improving the provenance ecosystem, continuing to
collaborate on this issue across industry and with civil society, and
helping build context and transparency to content created from ChatGPT
Images 2.0 and across our products.
