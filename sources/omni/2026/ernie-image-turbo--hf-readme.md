ERNIE-Image-Turbo is an open text-to-image generation model developed by the ERNIE-Image team at Baidu. It is the distilled release of ERNIE-Image, built on the same single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) family and designed for fast generation with strong fidelity in only 8 inference steps. The model retains strong controllability in practical generation scenarios where accurate content realization matters as much as aesthetics. In particular, ERNIE-Image-Turbo remains strong on complex instruction following, text rendering, and structured image generation, making it well suited for posters, comics, multi-panel layouts, and other content creation tasks that require both visual quality and efficiency. It also supports a broad range of visual styles, including realistic photography, design-oriented imagery, and stylized aesthetic outputs.

</p>


**Highlights:**
- **Fast and efficient**: As the distilled checkpoint of ERNIE-Image, ERNIE-Image-Turbo delivers strong generation quality with only 8 inference steps, making it suitable for latency-sensitive applications.
- **Text rendering**: ERNIE-Image-Turbo performs well on dense, long-form, and layout-sensitive text, making it a strong choice for posters, infographics, UI-like images, and other text-heavy visual content.
- **Instruction following**: The model is able to follow complex prompts involving multiple objects, detailed relationships, and knowledge-intensive descriptions with strong reliability.
- **Structured generation**: ERNIE-Image-Turbo is effective for structured visual tasks such as posters, comics, storyboards, and multi-panel compositions, where layout and organization are critical.
- **Style coverage**: In addition to clean and readable design-oriented outputs, the model also supports realistic photography and distinctive stylized aesthetics, including softer and more cinematic visual tones.
- **Practical deployment**: Thanks to its compact size, ERNIE-Image-Turbo can run on consumer GPUs with 24G VRAM, which lowers the barrier for research, downstream use, and model adaptation.
