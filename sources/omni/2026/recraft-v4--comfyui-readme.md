This is a custom node for ComfyUI that allows you to use the Recraft AI API. Recraft V3 (code-named red_panda) is a text-to-image model with the ability to generate long texts, images in a wide list of styles, including custom brand styles. It's also possible to set up brand colors. As of today, it is SOTA in image generation, proven by Hugging Face’s industry-leading Text-to-Image Benchmark by Artificial Analysis.
