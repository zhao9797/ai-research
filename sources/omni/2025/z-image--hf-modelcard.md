Welcome to the official repository for the Z-Image（造相）project!

</div>



## ✨ Z-Image

Z-Image is a powerful and highly efficient image generation model family with **6B** parameters. Currently there are four variants:

- 🚀 **Z-Image-Turbo** – A distilled version of Z-Image that matches or exceeds leading competitors with only **8 NFEs** (Number of Function Evaluations). It offers **⚡️sub-second inference latency⚡️** on enterprise-grade H800 GPUs and fits comfortably within **16G VRAM consumer devices**. It excels in photorealistic image generation, bilingual text rendering (English & Chinese), and robust instruction adherence.

- 🎨 **Z-Image** – The foundation model behind Z-Image-Turbo. Z-Image focuses on **high-quality generation**, **rich aesthetics**, **strong diversity**, and **controllability**, well-suited for creative generation, **fine-tuning**, and downstream development. It supports a wide range of artistic styles, effective negative prompting, and high diversity across identities, poses, compositions, and layouts.

- 🧱 **Z-Image-Omni-Base** – The versatile foundation model capable of both **generation and editing tasks**. By releasing this checkpoint, we aim to unlock the full potential for community-driven fine-tuning and custom development, providing the most "raw" and diverse starting point for the open-source community.

- ✍️ **Z-Image-Edit** – A variant fine-tuned on Z-Image specifically for image editing tasks. It supports creative image-to-image generation with impressive instruction-following capabilities, allowing for precise edits based on natural language prompts.

### 🏗️ Model Architecture
We adopt a **Scalable Single-Stream DiT** (S3-DiT) architecture. In this setup, text, visual semantic tokens, and image VAE tokens are concatenated at the sequence level to serve as a unified input stream, maximizing parameter efficiency compared to dual-stream approaches.

### 🚀 Quick Start
Install the latest version of diffusers, use the following command:
<details>
  <summary><sup>Click here for details for why you need to install diffusers from source</sup></summary>

  We have submitted two pull requests ([#12703](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/12703) and [#12715](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/12715)) to the 🤗 diffusers repository to add support for Z-Image. Both PRs have been merged into the latest official diffusers release.
  Therefore, you need to install diffusers from source for the latest features and Z-Image support.

</details>

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

```python
import torch
from diffusers import ZImagePipeline

# 1. Load the pipeline
# Use bfloat16 for optimal performance on supported GPUs
pipe = ZImagePipeline.from_pretrained(
    "Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=False,
)
pipe.to("cuda")

# [Optional] Attention Backend
# Diffusers uses SDPA by default. Switch to Flash Attention for better efficiency if supported:
# pipe.transformer.set_attention_backend("flash")    # Enable Flash-Attention-2
# pipe.transformer.set_attention_backend("_flash_3") # Enable Flash-Attention-3

# [Optional] Model Compilation
# Compiling the DiT model accelerates inference, but the first run will take longer to compile.
# pipe.transformer.compile()

# [Optional] CPU Offloading
# Enable CPU offloading for memory-constrained devices.
# pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

## 🔬 Decoupled-DMD: The Acceleration Magic Behind Z-Image

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2511.22677-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22677)

Decoupled-DMD is the core few-step distillation algorithm that empowers the 8-step Z-Image model.

Our core insight in Decoupled-DMD  is that the success of existing DMD (Distributaion Matching Distillation) methods is the result of two independent, collaborating mechanisms:

-   **CFG Augmentation (CA)**: The primary **engine** 🚀 driving the distillation process, a factor largely overlooked in previous work.
-   **Distribution Matching (DM)**: Acts more as a **regularizer** ⚖️, ensuring the stability and quality of the generated output.

By recognizing and decoupling these two mechanisms, we were able to study and optimize them in isolation. This ultimately motivated us to develop an improved distillation process that significantly enhances the performance of few-step generation.

## 🤖 DMDR: Fusing DMD with Reinforcement Learning

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2511.13649-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13649)

Building upon the strong foundation of Decoupled-DMD, our 8-step Z-Image model has already demonstrated exceptional capabilities. To achieve further improvements in terms of semantic alignment, aesthetic quality, and structural coherence—while producing images with richer high-frequency details—we present **DMDR**.

Our core insight behind DMDR is that Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) can be synergistically integrated during the post-training of few-step models. We demonstrate that:

-   **RL Unlocks the Performance of DMD** 🚀
-   **DMD Effectively Regularizes RL** ⚖️
