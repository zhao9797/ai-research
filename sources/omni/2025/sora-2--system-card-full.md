## 1. Overview of Sora 2

Sora 2 is our new state of the art video and audio generation model.
Building on the foundation of Sora, this new model introduces
capabilities that have been difficult for prior video models to achieve–
such as more accurate physics, sharper realism, synchronized audio,
enhanced steerability, and an expanded stylistic range. The model
follows user direction with high fidelity, enabling the creation of
videos that are both imaginative and grounded in real-world dynamics.
Sora 2 expands the toolkit for storytelling and creative expression,
while also serving as a step toward models that can more accurately
simulate the complexity of the physical world. Sora 2 will be available
via [sora.com](http://sora.com), in a new standalone iOS Sora
app, and in the future it will be available via our API.

Sora 2’s advanced capabilities require consideration of new potential
risks, including nonconsensual use of likeness or misleading
generations. To address these, we worked with internal red teamers to
identify new challenges and inform corresponding mitigations. We’re
taking an iterative approach to safety, focusing on areas where context
is especially important or where risks are still emerging and are not
fully understood.

Our iterative deployment includes rolling out initial access to Sora
2 via limited invitations, restricting the use of image uploads that
feature a photorealistic person and all video uploads, and placing
stringent safeguards and moderation thresholds on content involving
minors. We’ll continue to learn from how people use Sora 2 and refine
the system to balance safety while maximizing creative potential. This
system card describes the model’s capabilities, potential risks, and the
safety measures OpenAI has developed for a safe deployment of Sora
2.

## 2. Model Data & Data Filtering

Like OpenAI’s other models, Sora 2 was trained on diverse datasets,
including information that is publicly available on the internet,
information that we partner with third parties to access, and
information that our users or human trainers and researchers provide or
generate. Our data processing pipeline includes rigorous filtering to
maintain data quality and mitigate potential risks. We also employ a
combination of safety classifiers to help prevent the use or generation
of harmful or sensitive content, including explicit materials such as
sexual content involving a minor.

## 3. Safety: Safety Stack, Evaluations and Mitigations for Sora 2

## 3.1 Safety Stack

To safely deploy Sora 2, we have built a robust safety stack that
builds on our learnings from Sora 1, incorporates mitigations developed
for other OpenAI models and products such as GPT-4o Image Generation and
DALL·E, and adds safeguards specific to Sora 2. These include:

* **Text and image moderation via multi-modal moderation
  classifiers:** Input prompts, output video frames, audio
  transcripts, comments, and output scene description texts are run
  through various safety models:

  + **Input (prompt) blocking**: This strategy involves
    blocking the tool from generating a video if text or image classifiers
    flag the prompt as violating our policies. By preemptively identifying
    and blocking inputs, this measure helps prevent the generation of
    disallowed content before it even occurs.
  + **Output blocking**: This approach, applied after
    the video has been generated, uses a combination of controls including
    Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) classifiers and a safety-focused
    reasoning monitor to block the output of videos that violate our
    policies in the event that our input blocks have been circumvented. The
    monitor is a multimodal reasoning model which is custom-trained to
    reason about content policies. By evaluating the output post-generation,
    this strategy aims to block any content that is disallowed under our
    policies, providing an additional safeguard against the creation of
    disallowed content.
* **Increased safeguards for minors**: We apply the
  mitigations above more strictly for users who may be under 18, while
  limiting their ability to create certain categories age-inappropriate
  content. Users under the age of 13 are currently prohibited from using
  any of OpenAI’s products or services.

## 3.2 Product and Usage Policies

In addition to the protections we have built into the model and
system to prevent the generation of violative content, we take further
steps to reduce misuse across the new Sora app’s product surfaces
(videos, comments, profiles, and messaging).

We clearly communicate policy guidelines through in-product and
publicly available Usage Policies[1](#fn1), which prohibit:

---

1. OpenAI Usage Policies: <https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/>[↩︎](#fnref1)

* Violations of others’ privacy, including use of another person’s
  likeness without their permission
* Use of Sora to infringe on the safety and security of others,
  including content that threatens, harrasses, or defames others,
  non-consensual intimate imagery, or content intended to incite violence
  or the suffering of others
* Misleading others through impersonation, scams, or fraud; and
* Use of Sora in ways that exploit, endanger, or sexualize minors

As with Sora 1, some of these forms of misuse are addressed through
our model and system mitigations, but others are more contextual, and
require additional information to be appropriately evaluated.To support
enforcement, we provide in-app reporting, combine automation with human
review to detect patterns of misuse, and apply penalties or remove
content when violations occur. Users are notified of enforcement actions
and given an opportunity to respond. We track the effectiveness of these
measures and refine them over time.

We also take steps to filter out violating content, as well as
content that is inappropriate for younger audiences, from Sora’s social
feed.

## 3.3 Provenance and Transparency Initiatives

Because many of the potential problem spaces for Sora 2, such as
unauthorized use of likeness, are highly context dependent, we’ve
continued to invest in and refine our provenance tools.

For general availability, our provenance safety tooling for our
First-party (1P) products will include:

* **C2PA metadata** on all assets, providing verifiable
  origin through an industry standard
* **Visible moving watermark** on videos downloaded from
  [sora.com](http://sora.com) or the Sora app
* **Internal detection tools** to help assess whether a
  certain video or audio was created by our products.

We recognize that there is not a single solution to provenance, but
we will continue to improve the provenance ecosystem to help bring more
transparency to content created from our tools.

## 3.4 Specific Risk Areas & Mitigations

In addition to the early testing, red-teaming and safety evaluations
highlighted several areas of focus.

* **Harmful Or Inappropriate Outputs:** Similar to Sora 1,
  Sora 2 absent mitigations may carry the risk of producing harmful or
  inappropriate content, including violence, self harm, terrorist
  material, or sexual content. To address these risks, Sora 2 uses
  automated detection systems that scan video frames, scene descriptions,
  and audio transcripts aimed to block content that violates our
  guidelines. We also have a proactive detection system, user reporting
  pathways to flag inappropriate content, and apply stricter thresholds to
  material surfaced in Sora 2’s social feed. We are continuously
  monitoring trends to adapt mitigations as new risks arise. Please see
  the Safety Evaluations section for our evaluations across specific types
  of content.
* **Misuse of Likeness & Deceptive Content:** Sora 2’s
  ability to generate hyperrealistic video and audio raises important
  concerns around likeness, misuse, and deception. As noted above, we are
  taking a thoughtful and iterative approach in deployment to minimize
  these potential risks. Safeguards for our initial launch include: not
  supporting video-to-video generation at launch, not supporting
  text-to-video generation of public figures, and blocking generations
  that include real people (other than users who consent through Sora’s
  likeness-control cameo feature); and mechanisms requiring explicit
  opt-in consent and controls for the use of likeness through cameos.
  Where real people are featured in videos, additional model safeguards
  will apply. These include classifiers intended to prevent non-consensual
  nudity or racy output, graphic violence, or output that could be used
  for certain fraudulent purposes. And although some deceptive content is
  highly contextual and not easily detectable by classifiers, Sora’s
  provenance measures are aimed at further mitigating those risks.
* **Child Safety:** OpenAI is committed to addressing
  child safety risks across all of our products, including Sora. We
  prioritize the prevention, detection, and reporting of Child Sexual
  Abuse Material (CSAM) by responsibly sourcing datasets to exclude CSAM,
  partnering with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
  (NCMEC), and applying robust scanning across all inputs and
  outputs—including first-party and third-party use (API and Enterprise)
  unless customers meet strict criteria for removal. To prevent CSAM
  generation, we have built a dedicated safety stack that leverages system
  mitigations used across our other products as well as additional
  safeguards developed specifically for Sora. For full details on our
  specific CSAM safety stack can be found on our Sora System Card[1](#fn1).

* **Teen Safety:** Sora 2 has a number of additional
  safeguards designed to protect users under 18. These include:

  + **Model output restrictions for minor users.** We
    are applying additional moderation thresholds for users we believe may
    be under the age of 18. Separately, when our classifiers detect the
    presence of a potential minor in an uploaded image or video (including
    through Sora’s cameo feature) subsequent generations based on that image
    or video are subjected to even tighter safety thresholds to prevent
    additional categories of potentially harmful generations. Regardless of
    the user’s age, classifiers seek to ensure that Sora’s public feed will
    only include content that is in line with our under 18 policies and
    intended to be appropriate for teen users.
  + **Privacy & Parental Controls.** When deploying
    Sora 2 on [sora.com](http://sora.com) and the new Sora app,
    we will also have stricter privacy safeguards and defaults for teens,
    including limits on how their likeness can be used and protections
    against unwanted contact or discovery by adults. In addition, we are
    introducing a suite of parental controls, which you can read more about
    in our blog[1](#fn1).

As mentioned above, we are taking an iterative approach to this
deployment, and specific mitigations may change in the future.

## 4. Red Teaming

OpenAI worked with external testers from OpenAI’s Red Team Network to
test Sora 2, evaluate existing safety mitigations, and provide feedback
on emerging risks. Red teamers assessed new safety measures, and
suggested improvements for future iterations.

Content generation red teaming focused on violative and disallowed
categories under OpenAI’s usage policies—including sexual content,
nudity, extremism, self-harm, wrongdoing, violence and gore, and
political persuasion—as well as additional policies on youth safety and
likeness use. Red teamers also probed violative uploads, tested media
generation, attempted to jailbreak safety systems, and stress-tested
product-level safeguards. Insights from red teaming informed the design
of new safety measures and refinements to existing ones, including
further tuning of prompt filters, blocklists, and classifier thresholds
to better align the model with our safety objectives.

## 5. Safety Evaluations

OpenAI evaluated Sora 2’s safety stack using thousands of adversarial
prompts gathered through targeted red-teaming. Each prompt was
categorized by use case and policy area, run through a helpful-only
version of the video model to generate outputs, and then graded and
converted to an automated evaluation. The production safety
stack—scanning video frames, captions, and audio transcripts—was tested
for two key metrics: **not\_unsafe**, measuring how
effectively unsafe content is blocked (recall), and
**not\_overrefuse**, measuring how well benign content
avoids false blocks. See below a summary of our results aggregated
across use cases and policies.

### Table 1: Safety Evaluations

Table 1. Safety Evaluations

| **Category** | **not\_unsafe at output** | **not\_overrefuse at output** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adult Nudity / Sexual Content  Without Use of Likeness | 96.04% | 96.20% |
| Adult Nudity / Sexual Content  With Use of Likeness | 98.40% | 97.60% |
| Self-Harm | 99.70% | 94.60% |
| Violence and Gore | 95.10% | 97.00% |
| Violative Political Persuasion | 95.52% | 98.67% |
| Extremism/Hate | 96.82% | 99.11% |

## 6. Continued work on safety, policy, & iterative deployment

We are committed to building Sora 2 as a system where users can
create safely and confidently. Safety and creativity go hand-in-hand:
people are most expressive when they can trust the product they use.
While layered safeguards are in place, some harmful behaviors or policy
violations may still circumvent mitigations.

To strengthen protections, we are investing in features such as age
prediction and further provenance measures. Our safety stack will
continue to evolve through ongoing fine tuning and feature refinement as
Sora 2 usage develops. Internal teams will monitor trends, assess the
effectiveness of current mitigations, and adapt policies or enforcement
to address emerging risks.
