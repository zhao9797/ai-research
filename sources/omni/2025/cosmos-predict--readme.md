> ## 🚀 [Cosmos 3 Has Arrived](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos)
>
> Cosmos 3 is NVIDIA's next-generation foundation model platform for Physical AI. Compared with Cosmos-Predict1, Cosmos 3 delivers significantly stronger world prediction capabilities, producing more accurate, coherent, and physically grounded future-state predictions across a wide range of environments and embodiments.
>
> Beyond improving prediction quality, Cosmos 3 unifies capabilities that previously required multiple specialized models. A single Cosmos 3 model can reason, predict future world states, transfer across domains and modalities, and generate actions and policies for embodied agents within one unified architecture.
>
> This repository is no longer under active development and will receive only limited maintenance updates. Future model releases, features, documentation, and community support will be focused on Cosmos 3.
>
> 👉 Visit the new Cosmos home: https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos
>
> There you will find the latest Cosmos 3 models, technical reports, tutorials, benchmarks, and ecosystem updates.
>
> Thank you for your support of Cosmos-Predict1. We encourage all users to migrate to Cosmos 3 for the latest state-of-the-art Physical AI capabilities.

Cosmos-Predict1 is a key branch of Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs) specialized for future state prediction, often referred to as world models. The tree main branches of Cosmos WFMs are [cosmos-predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict1), [cosmos-transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1), and [cosmos-reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1). We visualize the architecture of Cosmos-Predict1 in the following figure.

Cosmos-Predict1 includes the following:

- **Diffusion-based world foundation models** for Text2World and Video2World generation, where a user can generate visual simulation based on text prompts and video prompts.
- **Autoregressive-based world foundation models** for Video2World generation, where a user can generate visual simulation based on video prompts and optional text prompts.
- **Image and video tokenizers** for tokenizing videos into continuous tokens (latent vectors) and discrete tokens (integers) efficiently and effectively.
- **Post-training scripts** for helping Physical AI builders post-train pre-trained Cosmos-Predict1 for their applications.

## News
