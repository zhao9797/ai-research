## 📖 Introduction
We present HunyuanVideo-1.5, a lightweight yet powerful video generation model that achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and motion coherence with only 8.3 billion parameters, enabling efficient inference on consumer-grade GPUs. This achievement is built upon several key components, including meticulous data curation, an advanced DiT architecture with selective and sliding tile attention(SSTA), enhanced bilingual understanding through glyph-aware text encoding, progressive pre-training and post-training, and an efficient video super-resolution network. Leveraging these designs, we developed a unified framework capable of high-quality text-to-video and image-to-video generation across multiple durations and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this compact and proficient model establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-source models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanVideo-1.5, we provide the community with a high-performance foundation that significantly lowers the cost of video creation and research, making advanced video generation more accessible to all.


## ✨ Key Features
- **Lightweight High-Performance Architecture**: We propose an efficient architecture that integrates an 8.3B-parameter Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a 3D causal VAE, achieving compression ratios of 16× in spatial dimensions and 4× along the temporal axis. Additionally, the innovative SSTA (Selective and Sliding Tile Attention) mechanism prunes redundant spatiotemporal kv blocks, significantly reducing computational overhead for long video sequences and accelerates inference, achieving an end-to-end speedup of $1.87 \times$ in 10-second 720p video synthesis compared to FlashAttention-3.

</div> 


- **Video Super-Resolution Enhancement**: We develop an efficient few-step super-resolution network that upscales outputs to 1080p. It enhances sharpness while correcting distortions, thereby refining details and overall visual texture.

</div> 

- **End-to-End Training Optimization**: This work employs a multi-stage, progressive training strategy covering the entire pipeline from pre-training to post-training. Combined with the Muon optimizer to accelerate convergence, this approach holistically refines motion coherence, aesthetic quality, and human preference alignment, achieving professional-grade content generation.

## 📝 Prompt Guide
### Prompt Writing Handbook
Prompt enhancement plays a crucial role in enabling our model to generate high-quality videos. By writing longer and more detailed prompts, the generated video will be significantly improved. We encourage you to craft comprehensive and descriptive prompts to achieve the best possible video quality. We recommend community partners consulting our official guide on how to write effective prompts. 

**Reference:** **[HunyuanVideo-1.5 Prompt Handbook](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanVideo-1.5/blob/main/assets/HunyuanVideo_1_5_Prompt_Handbook_EN.md)**

### System Prompts for Automatic Prompt Enhancement
For users seeking to optimize prompts for other large models, it is recommended to consult the definition of `t2v_rewrite_system_prompt` in the file `hyvideo/utils/rewrite/t2v_prompt.py` to guide text-to-video rewriting. Similarly, for image-to-video rewriting, refer to the definition of `i2v_rewrite_system_prompt` in `hyvideo/utils/rewrite/i2v_prompt.py`.

## 🔑 Inference

### Inference with Source Code


For prompt rewriting, we recommend using Gemini or models deployed via vLLM. This codebase currently only supports models compatible with the vLLM API. If you wish to use Gemini, you will need to implement your own interface calls.

For models with a vLLM API, note that T2V (text-to-video) and I2V (image-to-video) have different recommended models and environment variables:

- T2V: use [Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507), configure `T2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL` and `T2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME`
- I2V: use [Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct), configure `I2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL` and `I2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME`

> You may set the above model names to any other vLLM-compatible models you have deployed (including HuggingFace models).  
> Rewriting is enabled by default (`--rewrite` defaults to `true`); to disable it explicitly, use `--rewrite false` or `--rewrite 0`. If no vLLM endpoint is configured, the pipeline runs without remote rewriting.

Example: Generate a video (works for both T2V and I2V; set `IMAGE_PATH=none` for T2V or provide an image path for I2V)

> 💡 **Tip**: For faster inference speed, you can enable the step-distilled model using the `--enable_step_distill` parameter. The step-distilled model (480p I2V) can generate videos in 8 or 12 steps (recommended), achieving up to 75% speedup on RTX 4090 while maintaining comparable quality.
>
> **Tips:** If your GPU memory is > 14GB but you encounter OOM (Out of Memory) errors during generation, you can try setting the following environment variable before running:
> ```bash
> export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True,max_split_size_mb:128
> ```
> 
> **Tips:** If you have limited CPU memory and encounter OOM during inference, you can try disable overlapped group offloading by adding the following argument:
> ```bash
> --overlap_group_offloading false
> ```

```bash
export T2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL="<your_vllm_server_base_url>"
export T2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME="<your_model_name>"
export I2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL="<your_vllm_server_base_url>"
export I2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME="<your_model_name>"

## 🎓 Training

HunyuanVideo-1.5 is trained using the **Muon optimizer**, which accelerates convergence and improves training stability. The Muon optimizer combines momentum-based updates with Newton-Schulz orthogonalization for efficient optimization of large-scale video generation models.

### Quick Start

The training script (`train.py`) provides a complete training pipeline for HunyuanVideo-1.5. Here's how to use it:

#### 1. Implement Your DataLoader

Replace the `create_dummy_dataloader()` function in `train.py` with your own implementation. Your dataset's `__getitem__` method should return a single sample.

- **Required fields:**
  - `"pixel_values"`: `torch.Tensor` - Video: `[C, F, H, W]` or Image: `[C, H, W]`
    - Pixel values must be in range `[-1, 1]` 
    - Note: For video data, temporal dimension F must be `4n+1` (e.g., 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, ...)
  - `"text"`: `str` - Text prompt for this sample
  - `"data_type"`: `str` - `"video"` or `"image"`

- **Optional fields (for performance optimization):**
  - `"latents"`: Pre-encoded VAE latents (skips VAE encoding for faster training)
  - `"byt5_text_ids"` and `"byt5_text_mask"`: Pre-tokenized byT5 inputs

See the `create_dummy_dataloader()` function in `train.py` for detailed format documentation.

#### 2. Run Training

**Single GPU:**
```bash
python train.py --pretrained_model_root <path_to_pretrained_model> [other args]

## 📊 Evaluation

### Rating
We assess text-to-video generation using a comprehensive rating methodology that considers five key dimensions: text-video consistency, visual quality, structural stability, motion effects, and the aesthetic quality of individual frames. For image-to-video generation, the evaluation encompasses image-video consistency, instruction responsiveness, visual quality, structural stability, and motion effects.

</div> 


### GSB
The GSB(Good/Same/Bad) approach is widely used to evaluate the relative performance of two models based on overall video perception quality.We carefully construct 300 diverse text prompts and 300 image samples to cover balanced application scenarios for both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. For each prompt or image input, an equal number of video samples are generated by each model in a single run to ensure comparability. To maintain fairness, inference is performed only once per input without any cherry-picking of results. All competing models are evaluated using their default configurations. The evaluation is conducted by over 100 professional assessors

Initially, a larger, perfectly round dewdrop clings to the upper section of the leaf, its surface tension holding it in place. Then, as the leaf sways almost imperceptibly, the dewdrop begins to slowly dislodge. Next, it starts to trickle down the central vein of the leaf, its shape elongating slightly as it moves, leaving a subtle, glistening wet trail in its path. Finally, it reaches the pointed tip of the leaf, hangs for a brief moment, and falls out of the bottom of the frame. In the background, other leaves and blades of grass are softly blurred, creating a beautiful bokeh effect with soft, out-of-focus circles of light. The environment is bathed in the warm, golden glow of early morning sunlight, which streams in from behind the leaves, backlighting them and causing their wet edges to shine brilliantly. The overall impression is one of serene, natural beauty, captured in a highly realistic and detailed manner. This is a macro shot. The camera tilts down very slowly, following the path of the main dewdrop as it travels down the leaf.

On a flat, laid-out sheet of off-white Chinese Xuan paper with a subtle, fibrous texture, the scene unfolds. Initially, a single, concentrated drop of deep black ink falls into a clear, wet area at the center of the paper. Then, the ink instantly begins to bloom outwards in intricate, flowing tendrils of varying shades from jet-black to smoky grey. As it spreads, the ink wash naturally and rapidly forms the silhouette of a majestic mountain range with sharp, defined peaks. Next, softer, diluted grey tones billow around the mountains, creating layers of atmospheric mist and clouds, while a simple, dark stroke materializes as a lone boat on a tranquil, watery expanse at the base. As the landscape is formed, the ink elements—the lines of the mountains, wisps of cloud, and the shape of the boat—begin to deconstruct, dissolving into flowing streams of liquid ink. Finally, these streams move gracefully across the paper's empty white space, converging and elegantly reorganizing to form the text "Hunyuan Video 1.5" in a fluid, semi-cursive calligraphic style. The background is the minimalist expanse of the Xuan paper itself, its texture providing a subtle depth. The entire process is lit by soft, even, diffused light from above, which enhances the rich tonal variations of the ink and the delicate texture of the paper without creating harsh shadows.

She is positioned before a large, baroque-style oil painting in an ornate, gilded frame. Inside the painting, an aristocratic man with a mustache, dressed in a dark velvet doublet with a white lace collar, is depicted. His form is defined by visible, impasto oil brushstrokes. Initially, the woman watches the painting with calm poise. Then, the painted man's arm slowly animates, his painted texture retained as he lifts a dark bottle. Next, a photorealistic stream of red wine emerges directly from the flat canvas surface, arcing through the air and splashing gently into the real crystal glass she holds. She remains perfectly still, accepting the impossible pour with a subtle, knowing smile. The setting is a modern art gallery with high white walls and polished dark concrete floors that reflect the ambient light. Focused track lighting from the high ceiling casts a warm, dramatic spotlight on the woman and the painting, creating soft shadows.

A male hand with visible, realistic skin texture is wrapped firmly around the middle of an intact, pristine red and white aluminum soda can. The can, covered in glistening condensation droplets, rests on a dark, polished wooden surface. The cinematic realism captures every minute detail of the scene. Initially, the hand's grip is steady, with the can's cylindrical shape perfectly preserved. Then, the fingers begin to tighten slowly, the knuckles whitening slightly from the exertion. Next, the smooth aluminum surface starts to buckle under the controlled pressure, a sharp crease forming vertically down its side as the metallic sheen distorts. As the hand continues its deliberate squeeze, the can collapses inward progressively, the vibrant red paint wrinkling as the metal structure crumples. Finally, the can is left significantly crushed, its form now an irregular, crumpled shape held tightly in the fist. The scene takes place on a dark, polished wooden tabletop that catches soft, diffuse reflections. The grain of the wood is faintly discernible, adding a layer of texture to the foreground. The background is completely out of focus, rendered as a soft, dark, and non-descript blur, which isolates the main action and enhances the photorealistic quality of the shot.

In the foreground and mid-ground, oversized flowers with swirled purple and orange petals stand on thick green stems. The ground is a textured mat of green clay, showing subtle fingerprints and tool marks that add to the handmade charm. In the background, a pale blue clay backdrop features a simplified, smiling sun molded from yellow clay. The shot is at an eye-level angle with the main subject. The camera follows the subject, moving smoothly to the right to keep her in the frame. The lighting is bright and even, casting soft shadows that emphasize the rounded, three-dimensional forms of the clay models. The overall video presents a charming and detailed claymation style.``` </details>|
