## Introduction
**OmniGen2** is a powerful and efficient unified multimodal model. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. OmniGen2 has competitive performance across four primary capabilities:

- **Visual Understanding**: Inherits the robust ability to interpret and analyze image content from its Qwen-VL-2.5 foundation.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Creates high-fidelity and aesthetically pleasing images from textual prompts.
- **Instruction-guided Image Editing**: Executes complex, instruction-based image modifications with high precision, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.
- **In-context Generation**: A versatile capability to process and flexibly combine diverse inputs—including humans, reference objects, and scenes—to produce novel and coherent visual outputs.

As an open-source project, OmniGen2 provides a powerful yet resource-efficient foundation for researchers and developers exploring the frontiers of controllable and personalized generative AI.

**We will release the training code, dataset, and data construction pipeline soon. Stay tuned!**

## 💡 Usage Tips
To achieve optimal results with OmniGen2, you can adjust the following key hyperparameters based on your specific use case.
- `text_guidance_scale`: Controls how strictly the output adheres to the text prompt (Classifier-Free Guidance).
- `image_guidance_scale`: This controls how much the final image should resemble the input reference image.
    - **The Trade-off**: A higher value makes the output more faithful to the reference image's structure and style, but it might ignore parts of your text prompt. A lower value (~1.5) gives the text prompt more influence.
    - **Tip**: For image editing task, we recommend to set it between 1.2 and 2.0; for in-context generateion task, a higher image_guidance_scale will maintian more details in input images, and we recommend to set it between 2.5 and 3.0.
- `max_pixels`: Automatically resizes images when their total pixel count (width × height) exceeds this limit, while maintaining its aspect ratio. This helps manage performance and memory usage.
  - **Tip**: Default value is 1024*1024. You can reduce this value if you encounter memory issues.
- `max_input_image_side_length`: Maximum side length for input images.
- `negative_prompt`: Tell the model what you don't want to see in the image.
    - **Example**: blurry, low quality, text, watermark
    - **Tip**: For the best results, try experimenting with different negative prompts. If you're not sure, just use the default negative prompt.
- `enable_model_cpu_offload`: **Reduces VRAM usage by nearly 50% with a negligible impact on speed**.
  - This is achieved by offloading the model weights to CPU RAM when they are not in use.
  - See: [Model Offloading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory#model-offloading)
- `enable_sequential_cpu_offload`: Minimizes VRAM usage to less than 3GB, but at the cost of significantly slower performance.
  - This works by offloading the model in submodules and loading them onto the GPU sequentially as needed.
  - See: [CPU Offloading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory#cpu-offloading)
- `cfg_range_start`, `cfg_range_end`: Define the timestep range where CFG is applied. Per this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724), reducing `cfg_range_end` can significantly decrease inference time with a negligible impact on quality.
  
**Some suggestions for improving generation quality:**
1. Use High-Quality Images
  - Provide clear images, preferably with a resolution **greater than 512×512 pixels**.
  - Small or blurry inputs will result in low-quality outputs.
2. Be Specific with Instructions
  - Clearly describe both **what to change** and **how you want it changed**.
  - For in-context generation tasks, explicitly state which elements should come from which image. For example, instead of "Add bird to desk", say "Add the bird from image 1 onto the desk in image 2."
3. Prioritize English
The model currently performs best with **English** prompts.

## 💻 Resources Requirement
OmniGen2 natively requires an **NVIDIA RTX 3090** or an equivalent GPU with approximately **17GB of VRAM**. For devices with less VRAM, you can enable **CPU Offload** to run the model.

**Performance Tip**: To improve inference speed, consider decreasing the `cfg_range_end` parameter. Within a reasonable range, this has a negligible impact on output quality.
