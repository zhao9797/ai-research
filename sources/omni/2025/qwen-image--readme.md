```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype).to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", 超清，4K，电影级构图." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee 😊 $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "通义千问". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "π≈3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.

    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Qwen-Image-Edit (for Image Editing, Only Support Single Image Input)
> [!NOTE]
> Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 has better consistency than Qwen-Image-Edit; it is recommended to use Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 directly，for both single image input and multiple image inputs.


```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```



> [!NOTE]
> We have observed that editing results may become unstable if prompt rewriting is not used. Therefore, we strongly recommend applying prompt rewriting to improve the stability of editing tasks. For reference, please see our official [demo script](src/examples/tools/prompt_utils.py) or Advanced Usage below, which includes example system prompts. Qwen-Image-Edit is actively evolving with ongoing development. Stay tuned for future enhancements!

### Showcase of Qwen-Image-2512
**Enhanced Huamn Realism**

In Qwen-Image-2512, human depiction has been substantially refined. Compared to the August release, Qwen-Image-2512 adds significantly richer facial details and better environmental context. For example:


> A Chinese female college student, around 20 years old, with a very short haircut that conveys a gentle, artistic vibe. Her hair naturally falls to partially cover her cheeks, projecting a tomboyish yet charming demeanor. She has cool-toned fair skin and delicate features, with a slightly shy yet subtly confident expression—her mouth crooked in a playful, youthful smirk. She wears an off-shoulder top, revealing one shoulder, with a well-proportioned figure. The image is framed as a close-up selfie: she dominates the foreground, while the background clearly shows her dormitory—a neatly made bed with white linens on the top bunk, a tidy study desk with organized stationery, and wooden cabinets and drawers. The photo is captured on a smartphone under soft, even ambient lighting, with natural tones, high clarity, and a bright, lively atmosphere full of youthful, everyday energy.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/image2512/幻灯片1.JPG#center)

For the same prompt, Qwen-Image-2512 yields notably more lifelike facial features, and background objects—e.g., the desk, stationery, and bedding—are rendered with significantly greater clarity than in Qwen-Image.


> A 20-year-old East Asian girl with delicate, charming features and large, bright brown eyes—expressive and lively, with a cheerful or subtly smiling expression. Her naturally wavy long hair is either loose or tied in twin ponytails. She has fair skin and light makeup accentuating her youthful freshness. She wears a modern, cute dress or relaxed outfit in bright, soft colors—lightweight fabric, minimalist cut. She stands indoors at an anime convention, surrounded by banners, posters, or stalls. Lighting is typical indoor illumination—no staged lighting—and the image resembles a casual iPhone snapshot: unpretentious composition, yet brimming with vivid, fresh, youthful charm.


![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/image2512/幻灯片2.JPG#center)

Here, hair strands serve as a key differentiator: Qwen-Image’s August version tends to blur them together, losing fine detail, whereas Qwen-Image-2512 renders individual strands with precision, resulting in a more natural and realistic appearance.

Another case:

> An East Asian teenage boy, aged 15–18, with soft, fluffy black short hair and refined facial contours. His large, warm brown eyes sparkle with energy. His fair skin and sunny, open smile convey an approachable, friendly demeanor—no makeup or blemishes. He wears a blue-and-white summer uniform shirt, slightly unbuttoned, made of thin breathable fabric, with black headphones hanging around his neck. His hands are in his pockets, body leaning slightly forward in a relaxed pose, as if engaged in conversation. Behind him lies a summer school playground: lush green grass and a red rubber track in the foreground, blurred school buildings in the distance, a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The bright, airy lighting evokes a joyful, carefree adolescent atmosphere.



![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/image2512/幻灯片3.JPG#center)

In this example, Qwen-Image-2512 better adheres to semantic instructions—for instance, the prompt specifies “body leaning slightly forward,” and Qwen-Image-2512 accurately captures this posture, unlike its predecessor.


> An elderly Chinese couple in their 70s in a clean, organized home kitchen. The woman has a kind face and a warm smile, wearing a patterned apron; the man stands behind her, also smiling, as they both gaze at a steaming pot of buns on the stove. The kitchen is bright and tidy, exuding warmth and harmony. The scene is captured with a wide-angle lens to fully show the subjects and their surroundings.



![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/image2512/幻灯片4.JPG#center)

This comparison starkly highlights the gap between the August and December models. The original Qwen-Image struggles to accurately render aged facial features (e.g., wrinkles), resulting in an artificial “AI look.” In contrast, Qwen-Image-2512 precisely captures age cues, dramatically boosting realism.



**Finer Natural Detail**

Qwen-Image-2512’s enhanced detail rendering extends beyond humans—to landscapes, wildlife, and more. For instance:


> A turquoise river winds through a lush canyon. Thick moss and dense ferns blanket the rocky walls; multiple waterfalls cascade from above, enveloped in mist. At noon, sunlight filters through the dense canopy, dappling the river surface with shimmering light. The atmosphere is humid and fresh, pulsing with primal jungle vitality. No humans, text, or artificial traces present.



![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/image2512/幻灯片5.JPG#center)

Side-by-side, Qwen-Image-2512 exhibits superior fidelity in water flow, foliage, and waterfall mist—and renders richer gradation in greens. Another example (wave rendering):


> At dawn, a thin mist veils the sea. An ancient stone lighthouse stands at the cliff’s edge, its beacon faintly visible through the fog. Black rocks are pounded by waves, sending up bursts of white spray. The sky glows in soft blue-purple hues under cool, hazy light—evoking solitude and solemn grandeur.

Fur detail is another highlight—here, a golden retriever portrait:


> An ultra-realistic close-up of a golden retriever outdoors under soft daylight. Hair is exquisitely detailed: strands distinct, color transitioning naturally from warm gold to light cream, light glinting delicately at the tips; a gentle breeze adds subtle volume. Undercoat is soft and dense; guard hairs are long and well-defined, with visible layering. Eyes are moist, expressive; nose is slightly damp with fine specular highlights. Background is softly blurred to emphasize the dog’s tangible texture and vivid expression.

Similarly, texture quality improves in depictions of rugged wildlife—for example, a male argali sheep:


> A male argali stands atop a barren, rocky mountainside. Its coarse, dense grey-brown coat covers a powerful, muscular body. Most striking are its massive, thick, outward-spiraling horns—a symbol of wild strength. Its gaze is alert and sharp. The background reveals steep alpine terrain: jagged peaks, sparse low vegetation, and abundant sunlight—conveying the harsh yet majestic wilderness and the animal’s resilient vitality.

## AI Arena

To comprehensively evaluate the general image generation capabilities of Qwen-Image and objectively compare it with state-of-the-art closed-source APIs, we introduce [AI Arena](https://aiarena.alibaba-inc.com), an open benchmarking platform built on the Elo rating system. AI Arena provides a fair, transparent, and dynamic environment for model evaluation.

In each round, two images—generated by randomly selected models from the same prompt—are anonymously presented to users for pairwise comparison. Users vote for the better image, and the results are used to update both personal and global leaderboards via the Elo algorithm, enabling developers, researchers, and the public to assess model performance in a robust and data-driven way. AI Arena is now publicly available, welcoming everyone to participate in model evaluations. 

![AI Arena](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/figure_aiarena_website.png)

The latest leaderboard rankings can be viewed at [AI Arena Learboard](https://aiarena.alibaba-inc.com/corpora/arena/leaderboard?arenaType=text2image).

If you wish to deploy your model on AI Arena and participate in the evaluation, please contact weiyue.wy@alibaba-inc.com.
