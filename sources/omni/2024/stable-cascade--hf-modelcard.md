# Stable Cascade

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->
<img src="figures/collage_1.jpg" width="800">

This model is built upon the [Würstchen](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gU58d5QeGv) architecture and its main
difference to other models like Stable Diffusion is that it is working at a much smaller latent space. Why is this
important? The smaller the latent space, the **faster** you can run inference and the **cheaper** the training becomes.
How small is the latent space? Stable Diffusion uses a compression factor of 8, resulting in a 1024x1024 image being
encoded to 128x128. Stable Cascade achieves a compression factor of 42, meaning that it is possible to encode a
1024x1024 image to 24x24, while maintaining crisp reconstructions. The text-conditional model is then trained in the
highly compressed latent space. Previous versions of this architecture, achieved a 16x cost reduction over Stable
Diffusion 1.5. <br> <br>
Therefore, this kind of model is well suited for usages where efficiency is important. Furthermore, all known extensions
like finetuning, LoRA, ControlNet, IP-Adapter, LCM etc. are possible with this method as well.

## Model Details

- **Model type:** Generative text-to-image model

### Model Sources

For research purposes, we recommend our `StableCascade` Github repository (https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableCascade).

### Model Overview
Stable Cascade consists of three models: Stage A, Stage B and Stage C, representing a cascade to generate images,
hence the name "Stable Cascade".
Stage A & B are used to compress images, similar to what the job of the VAE is in Stable Diffusion.
However, with this setup, a much higher compression of images can be achieved. While the Stable Diffusion models use a
spatial compression factor of 8, encoding an image with resolution of 1024 x 1024 to 128 x 128, Stable Cascade achieves
a compression factor of 42. This encodes a 1024 x 1024 image to 24 x 24, while being able to accurately decode the
image. This comes with the great benefit of cheaper training and inference. Furthermore, Stage C is responsible
for generating the small 24 x 24 latents given a text prompt. The following picture shows this visually.

For this release, we are providing two checkpoints for Stage C, two for Stage B and one for Stage A. Stage C comes with
a 1 billion and 3.6 billion parameter version, but we highly recommend using the 3.6 billion version, as most work was
put into its finetuning. The two versions for Stage B amount to 700 million and 1.5 billion parameters. Both achieve
great results, however the 1.5 billion excels at reconstructing small and fine details. Therefore, you will achieve the
best results if you use the larger variant of each. Lastly, Stage A contains 20 million parameters and is fixed due to
its small size.

## Evaluation
<img height="300" src="figures/comparison.png"/>
According to our evaluation, Stable Cascade performs best in both prompt alignment and aesthetic quality in almost all
comparisons. The above picture shows the results from a human evaluation using a mix of parti-prompts (link) and
aesthetic prompts. Specifically, Stable Cascade (30 inference steps) was compared against Playground v2 (50 inference
steps), SDXL (50 inference steps), SDXL Turbo (1 inference step) and Würstchen v2 (30 inference steps).

## Code Example

**Note:** In order to use the `torch.bfloat16` data type with the `StableCascadeDecoderPipeline` you need to have PyTorch 2.2.0 or higher installed. This also means that using the `StableCascadeCombinedPipeline` with `torch.bfloat16` requires PyTorch 2.2.0 or higher, since it calls the StableCascadeDecoderPipeline internally.

If it is not possible to install PyTorch 2.2.0 or higher in your environment, the `StableCascadeDecoderPipeline` can be used on its own with the torch.float16 data type. You can download the full precision or bf16 variant weights for the pipeline and cast the weights to torch.float16.

```shell
pip install diffusers
```

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableCascadeDecoderPipeline, StableCascadePriorPipeline

prompt = "an image of a shiba inu, donning a spacesuit and helmet"
negative_prompt = ""

prior = StableCascadePriorPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade-prior", variant="bf16", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
decoder = StableCascadeDecoderPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade", variant="bf16", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

prior.enable_model_cpu_offload()
prior_output = prior(
    prompt=prompt,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    guidance_scale=4.0,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=20
)

decoder.enable_model_cpu_offload()
decoder_output = decoder(
    image_embeddings=prior_output.image_embeddings.to(torch.float16),
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    guidance_scale=0.0,
    output_type="pil",
    num_inference_steps=10
).images[0]
decoder_output.save("cascade.png")
```

### Using the Lite Version of the Stage B and Stage C models

```python
import torch
from diffusers import (
    StableCascadeDecoderPipeline,
    StableCascadePriorPipeline,
    StableCascadeUNet,
)

prompt = "an image of a shiba inu, donning a spacesuit and helmet"
negative_prompt = ""

prior_unet = StableCascadeUNet.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade-prior", subfolder="prior_lite")
decoder_unet = StableCascadeUNet.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade", subfolder="decoder_lite")

prior = StableCascadePriorPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade-prior", prior=prior_unet)
decoder = StableCascadeDecoderPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade", decoder=decoder_unet)

prior.enable_model_cpu_offload()
prior_output = prior(
    prompt=prompt,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    guidance_scale=4.0,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=20
)

decoder.enable_model_cpu_offload()
decoder_output = decoder(
    image_embeddings=prior_output.image_embeddings,
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    guidance_scale=0.0,
    output_type="pil",
    num_inference_steps=10
).images[0]
decoder_output.save("cascade.png")
```

### Loading original checkpoints with `from_single_file`

Loading the original format checkpoints is supported via `from_single_file` method in the StableCascadeUNet.

```python
import torch
from diffusers import (
    StableCascadeDecoderPipeline,
    StableCascadePriorPipeline,
    StableCascadeUNet,
)

prompt = "an image of a shiba inu, donning a spacesuit and helmet"
negative_prompt = ""

prior_unet = StableCascadeUNet.from_single_file(
    "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-cascade/resolve/main/stage_c_bf16.safetensors",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)
decoder_unet = StableCascadeUNet.from_single_file(
    "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-cascade/blob/main/stage_b_bf16.safetensors",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)

prior = StableCascadePriorPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade-prior", prior=prior_unet, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
decoder = StableCascadeDecoderPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade", decoder=decoder_unet, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

prior.enable_model_cpu_offload()
prior_output = prior(
    prompt=prompt,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    guidance_scale=4.0,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=20
)

decoder.enable_model_cpu_offload()
decoder_output = decoder(
    image_embeddings=prior_output.image_embeddings,
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    guidance_scale=0.0,
    output_type="pil",
    num_inference_steps=10
).images[0]
decoder_output.save("cascade-single-file.png")
```

### Using the `StableCascadeCombinedPipeline`

```python
from diffusers import StableCascadeCombinedPipeline

pipe = StableCascadeCombinedPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-cascade", variant="bf16", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

prompt = "an image of a shiba inu, donning a spacesuit and helmet"
pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt="",
    num_inference_steps=10,
    prior_num_inference_steps=20,
    prior_guidance_scale=3.0,
