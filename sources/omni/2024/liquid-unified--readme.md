  - [ ] Checkpoints

# 📽️Inference

Using Liquid for inference or evaluation doesn't require complex environment dependencies. Since it's essentially a HuggingFace format language model, you only need the `transformers` library and some basic components to run it. Refer to [EVAL.md](evaluation/EVAL.md) for recommended versions.

### Run the Gradio Demo locally

If deploying on a GPU with less than 30GB VRAM, you may need to enable `load_in_8bit` in `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` in `app.py` for image generation to avoid out-of-memory errors.

```bash
pip install gradio==4.44.1
pip install gradio_client==1.3.0

cd evaluation
python app.py
```

### Single inference

```bash
# Engage in pure language dialogue.

python inference_t2t.py  --model_path Junfeng5/Liquid_V1_7B  --prompt  "Write me a poem about Machine Learning."


# image understanding
python inference_i2t.py --model_path Junfeng5/Liquid_V1_7B  --image_path samples/baklava.png   --prompt 'How to make this pastry?'


# image generation, add --load_8bit for GPU with less than 30GB VRAM
python inference_t2i.py   --model_path Junfeng5/Liquid_V1_7B --prompt "young blue dragon with horn lightning in the style of dd fantasy full body"  
```



## ⚙️ Installation and Training

See [Data.md](./Data.md) and [TRAIN.md](./TRAIN.md).




## 📖 Introduction
* We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that **seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation.**

* Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. 

* For the first time, Liquid uncovers a **scaling law** that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases.

* Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to **mutually enhance each other**
