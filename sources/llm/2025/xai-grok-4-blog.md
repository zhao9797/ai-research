# Grok 4

Grok 4 is the most intelligent model in the world. It includes native tool use and real-time search integration, and is available now to SuperGrok and Premium+ subscribers, as well as through the xAI API. We are also introducing a new SuperGrok Heavy tier with access to Grok 4 Heavy - the most powerful version of Grok 4.

## [Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning](#scaling-up-reinforcement-learning)

With Grok 3, we scaled next-token prediction pretraining to unprecedented levels, resulting in a model with unparalleled world knowledge and performance. We also introduced Grok 3 Reasoning, which was trained using reinforcement learning to think longer about problems and solve them with increased accuracy. During our work on Grok 3 Reasoning, we noticed scaling trends that suggested it would be possible to scale up our reinforcement learning training significantly.

For Grok 4, we utilized Colossus, our 200,000 GPU cluster, to run reinforcement learning training that refines Grok's reasoning abilities at pretraining scale. This was made possible with innovations throughout the stack, including new infrastructure and algorithmic work that increased the compute efficiency of our training by 6x, as well as a massive data collection effort, where we significantly expanded our verifiable training data from primarily math and coding data to many more domains. The resulting training run saw smooth performance gains while training on over an order of magnitude more compute than had been used previously.

## [Native Tool Use](#native-tool-use)

Grok 4 was trained with reinforcement learning to use tools. This allows Grok to augment its thinking with tools like a code interpreter and web browsing in situations that are usually challenging for large language models. When searching for real-time information or answering difficult research questions, Grok 4 chooses its own search queries, finding knowledge from across the web and diving as deeply as it needs to craft a high-quality response.

We also trained Grok to use powerful tools to find information from deep within X. Grok can use advanced keyword and semantic search tools and even view media to improve the quality of its answers.

Based on your description, it sounds like you're referring to a viral X post from July7, 2025, complaining about a particularly frustrating category in the New York Times' daily Connections word puzzle (game #756). The puzzle involves grouping 16 words intofour themed categories, and one of them—the purple (hardest) group—was "ending withhomophones for parts of the leg." The words were crypto (sounds like it ends with"toe"), decaf (ends with "calf"), Disney (ends with "knee"), and Prussian (ends with"shin"). This stretched connection sparked a lot of outrage and memes online for being overly obscure and accent-dependent.

The specific popular post you might be thinking of shows a screenshot of the puzzle gridwith the caption "This game is a psyop to give me schizophrenia." It was posted by @LinkofSunshine and quickly went viral, racking up over 21,000 likes and hundreds of replies, quotes, and reposts within days. Many people in the replies echoed thefrustration, calling the leg-related category "ridiculous" or "impossible withoutguessing."

If this isn't the exact one you meant, let me know more details (like the username or exact phrasing), and I can dig deeper!

## [Grok 4 Heavy](#grok-4-heavy)

We have made further progress on parallel test-time compute, which allows Grok to consider multiple hypotheses at once. We call this model Grok 4 Heavy, and it sets a new standard for performance and reliability. Grok 4 Heavy saturates most academic benchmarks and is the first model to score 50% on Humanity's Last Exam, a benchmark "designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind."

## [Frontier Intelligence](#frontier-intelligence)

Grok 4 represents a leap in frontier intelligence, setting a new state-of-the-art for closed models on ARC-AGI V2 with 15.9% (nearly double Opus's ~8.6%, +8pp over previous high). On the agentic Vending-Bench, it dominates with $4694.15 net worth and 4569 units sold (averages across 5 runs), vastly outpacing Claude Opus 4 ($2077.41, 1412 units), humans ($844.05, 344 units), and others. Grok 4 Heavy leads USAMO'25 with 61.9%, and is the first to score 50.7% on Humanity's Last Exam (text-only subset), demonstrating unparalleled capabilities in complex reasoning through scaled reinforcement learning and native tool use.
